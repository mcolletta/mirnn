# mirnn
MiRNN is a Neural Network library implemented with the [Groovy programming language](http://www.groovy-lang.org/)

This library implements the algorithm described in the following paper:

[D. Monner and J.A. Reggia (2012). A generalized LSTM-like training algorithm for second-order recurrent neural networks](http://www.overcomplete.net/papers/nn2012.pdf)

while the implementation is based on the [Synaptic](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) javascript library.

The library is bundled with [MirComp](https://github.com/mcolletta/mircomp), the framework for algorithmic and assisted music composition.
